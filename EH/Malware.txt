Malware Threats : Worms, viruses, Trojans:

A computer worm is a type of malicious software or malware that is designed to replicate 
itself and spread independently to other computers over a network. Unlike viruses, worms do 
not require a host program to attach themselves to; instead, they can self-replicate and 
spread without user intervention. Worms can exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, 
network protocols, or software to propagate rapidly through interconnected computer systems.

A computer virus is a type of malicious software or malware that infects computer systems 
by attaching itself to other programs or files. The primary characteristic of a computer virus is
its ability to replicate and spread to other files or systems, often causing unwanted and harmful 
effects. Viruses can be designed to execute malicious actions, such as corrupting data, stealing information, 
or disrupting the normal operation of a computer or network.


A Trojan horse, often simply referred to as a "Trojan," is a type of malicious software or malware 
that disguises itself as a legitimate and benign program to deceive users into running or installing 
it on their computers. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves. Instead, they rely 
on social engineering tactics to trick users into executing them, and once activated, they can perform 
a variety of malicious activities.


Using the software tools/commands to perform the following ,
generate an analysis report :


A. Password cracking.
1) Create a python file. Give name - "ReadFile.py"
//
import hashlib
fileInput=input("Enter path of Possible Password Database file List : ")
mdhash=input("Enter the MD5 Hash to lookup for possibile match of password : ")
try:
  wordList=open(fileInput,"r")
except:
  print("No file found")
  quit()
flag=0
for word in wordList:
  word_encode=word.encode('utf-8')
  digest=hashlib.md5(word_encode.strip()).hexdigest()
  if mdhash==digest:
    print("Match Found ")
    print("Password Is "+word+" For the Given MD5 "+mdhash)
    flag=1
wordList.close()
if flag==0:
  print("No password Found for the given hash")
exit()
// 

2) Download pl.txt file in same folder for above python file
3) Open Goolge link "https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/" type "password" in box and generate
4) Open cmd for that folder 
Type -command1 - "python ReadFile.py"
      command2 - "pl.txt"
      command3 - "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"


B. Dictionary attack.
C. Encrypt and decrypt passwords.
D. DoS attack.
E. ARP poisoning in windows.
F. Ifconfig,ping,netstat, traceroute.
Open Terminal and type following commands
1) "ipconfig"
2) "ping www.google.com"
3) "tracert www.google.com"
4) "netstat"
5) "netstat -an"


G. Steganography tools.
1) Create a text file.(Suppose name Ex. "plain.txt")
2) Create a audio file.(Suppose name Ex. "senorita.mp3")
3) Create a video file.(Suppose name Ex. "fun.mp4")
4) All in one folder name "Steganography"
5) Open cmd for that folder
6) Type - "copy senorita.mp3 + plain.txt" (Same for video and another text file)
7) Now go back to folder steganography 
8) Right click on senorita.mp3 and open it with notepad.
