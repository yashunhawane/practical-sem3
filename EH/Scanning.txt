Scanning networks, Enumeration and sniffing:
Using the software tools/commands to perform the following ,
generate an analysis report :

Network scanning is the process of identifying active devices on a network, discovering open ports, 
and gathering information about the network structure. This technique is commonly used for both legitimate 
and malicious purposes. Legitimate uses include network administration, security assessments, 
and troubleshooting, while malicious uses involve identifying vulnerabilities for potential exploitation.

Network scanning tools, both open-source and commercial, are widely available. 
Examples include Nmap, Nessus, Wireshark, and others. It's important to note that unauthorized 
or malicious network scanning can violate ethical and legal standards. Organizations should 
conduct scanning activities within a well-defined scope, with proper authorization, and in 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations to ensure the security and privacy of the network and its users.

Enumeration, in the context of computer security and network penetration testing, refers to the 
process of extracting information about a target system or network to gather details that might be 
useful for further exploitation. Enumerating a system involves systematically extracting information 
about users, shares, services, and other resources. This phase is a critical step in the reconnaissance 
stage of ethical hacking and penetration testing.

In the context of computer networks and cybersecurity, "sniffing" refers to the practice of intercepting 
and inspecting network traffic. This is typically done using specialized tools or software designed for 
network sniffing. The primary purpose of network sniffing is to capture and analyze the data being transmitted 
over a network, which can include sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, or other confidential data.


A] Port scanning . Open Terminal(win + r)
1. Display the following for ip address 127.0.0.1 or any other ip address

a. Scan open ports (syntax: nmap â€“open ip_address / url )
1) Type - command-1 "nmap -open www.wikipedia.com"
2) Type - command-2 "nmap -open (ipaddress of your PC)"

b. Scan ports (syntax: nmap ip_address / url )
1) Type - command-1 "nmap www.wikipedia.com"
2) Type - command-2 "nmap (ipaddress of your PC)"

c. Scan single port (syntax: nmap -p 80 ip_address)
1) Type - command "nmap -p 80 (ipaddress of your PC)"

d. Scan specified range of ports (syntax: nmap -p 1-200 ip_address)
1) Type - command "nmap -p 1-200 (ipaddress of your PC)"

e. Scan entire port range (syntax: nmap -p 1-65535 ip_address)
1) Type - command "nmap -p 1- 65535(ipaddress of your PC)"

f. Scan top 100 ports (fast scan) (syntax: nmap -F ip_address)
1)  Type - command- "nmap -f (ipaddress of your PC)"


B] Network scanning tools Open Terminal(win + r)
a. Ping Scan (syntax: nmap -sP <IP Address>)
1) Type - command- "nmap -sP 103.108.220.91"

b. Host Scan (syntax: nmap -sP <target IP Range>)
1) Type - command- "nmap -sP 72.52.251.71"

c. UDP Scan (syntax: nmap -sU <target>)
1) Type - command- "nmap -sU www.google.com"

d. OS Detection Scan (syntax: nmap -sO <target>)
1) Type - command- "nmap -sO www.google.com"

e. Version Scan Scan (syntax: nmap -sV <target>)
1) Type - command- "nmap -sV www.google.com"


C] IDS tool
D] Sniffing tool
  Use Wireshark
