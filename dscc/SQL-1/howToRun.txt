Step 1: Compile the Java Code

Compile all the Java files using the javac command in the terminal or command prompt. Make sure you are in the directory where your Java files are located.

bash

javac Hello.java ImplExample.java Server.java Client.java Student.java

Step 2: Start the RMI Registry (On the Server Side)

Before running the server, you need to start the RMI registry. Open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

bash

rmiregistry

Step 3: Run the Server

Open another terminal or command prompt and run the server:

bash

java Server

The server should print "Server ready" if it starts successfully.
Step 4: Run the Client

Open another terminal or command prompt and run the client:

bash

java Client

The client should connect to the server, retrieve the list of students from the MySQL database, and print their information.
Note:

    Make sure your MySQL server is running.
    Ensure that the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file is included in your classpath.
    Update the MySQL database connection details (URL, username, and password) in ImplExample.java.
    Ensure that the RMI registry is started on the default port (1099).
    If you encounter any issues, check for error messages in the terminal or command prompt to diagnose the problem.

    Set up MySQL database and create the Book table:

sql

CREATE DATABASE Library;
USE Library;

CREATE TABLE Book (
    Book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Book_name VARCHAR(255),
    Book_author VARCHAR(255)
);

    Insert some sample data into the Book table:

sql

INSERT INTO Book (Book_id, Book_name, Book_author) VALUES
(1, 'Book1', 'Author1'),
(2, 'Book2', 'Author2'),
(3, 'Book3', 'Author3');
