Step 1: Compile the Java Code

Compile all the Java files using the javac command. Make sure you are in the directory where your Java files are located.

bash

javac Hello.java ImplExample.java Server.java Client.java Student.java

Step 2: Start the RMI Registry (On the Server Side)

Before running the server, you need to start the RMI registry. Open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

bash

rmiregistry

Step 3: Run the Server

Open another terminal or command prompt and run the server:

bash

java Server

The server should print "Server ready" if it starts successfully.
Step 4: Run the Client

Open another terminal or command prompt and run the client:

bash

java Client

The client should connect to the server, retrieve the list of students from the MySQL database, and print their information.
Notes:

    Make sure your MySQL server is running.
    Ensure that the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file is included in your classpath.
    Update the MySQL database connection details (URL, username, and password) in ImplExample.java.
    Ensure that the RMI registry is started on the default port (1099).
    If you encounter any issues, check for error messages in the terminal or command prompt to diagnose the problem.\

Step 1: Set up MySQL database and create the Bill table:

sql

CREATE DATABASE Electric_Bill;
USE Electric_Bill;

CREATE TABLE Bill (
    consumer_name VARCHAR(255),
    bill_due_date DATE,
    bill_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Step 2: Insert some sample data into the Bill table:

sql

INSERT INTO Bill (consumer_name, bill_due_date, bill_amount) VALUES
('Consumer1', '2024-02-01', 150.00),
('Consumer2', '2024-02-05', 200.50),
('Consumer3', '2024-02-10', 120.75);
